This is *italic* and **bold**.

## Section One

You can have bulleted and numbered lists, including nested lists:

1. foo
   a) lorem
   b) ipsum
2. bar
   * stuff
   * more stuff
3. baz

### A Sub-Section

You can even have definition lists!

term 1
: definition 1a
: definition 1b

term 2
: definition 2

## Another Section

Tables work too:

| Header 1  | Header 2  |
| --------- | --------- |
| Content 1 | Content 2 |
| Content 3 | Content 4 |

You can have external code samples:

![Hello World in Ruby](hello.rb)

You can also inline code samples:

{caption: "Hello World in Ruby"}
```ruby
puts "hello"
```

You can also include single lines of code like `puts "hello"` in paragraphs.

> Blockquotes are really easy too.

Finally, you can do that with math `d = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2`$ too.
